# Snake Game in Java
The classic Snake game has been around for decades, originally gaining popularity on Nokia mobile phones. This implementation uses Java and the Swing GUI toolkit for rendering and user input.

## Description
The Snake Game is simple. You control a snake that moves around the screen. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, grows in length, and increases in speed. The game ends when the snake runs into the screen border or itself.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
- A Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.) or a text editor.



## How to Play
1. When you run the game, you will be presented with an option to start the game. Click "Yes" to start.
   
2. The snake will start moving to the right by default. Control the snake using the arrow keys or W, A, S, D keys.

3. Eat the red apple that appears on the screen to grow the snake in length.

4. Avoid running into the screen border or into yourself.

5. The game ends when you collide with the border or yourself. You will be presented with your score and an option to restart.
